# List of Needed Changes

- Header:
  - Image should be left-aligned
  - buttons feels non-traditional. Also change pointer icon to be normal / deafult / readable
  - Drop down sections may not be useful. Change these to render different React components on the main page
  - Add succinct version of About to header -- perhaps same one from GitHub?

- Contact Form:
  - Change this to be an actual form. Use FormSubmit.co / connect to Google Sheets / Formspree.io

- Skills/Interests / About page:
  - Not currently quantifiable. Either improve it or remove it.
    - Open source
    - Epicodus projects
    - IT experience

- Projects:
  -Change projects section to carousel.
  - Replace some action buttons with icons (GitHub icon, live site icon, etc.)

- Styling:
  - Make sure everything passes WCAG Standards https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1#use-of-color
  - Make design a bit more modern. Drop shadows are a bit antiquated.
  - Hamburger menu / sticky header
