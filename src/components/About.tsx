          I have always been fascinated by technology and utilizing it to help meet real needs. Programming was a favorite hobby of mine from a young age and something that I always hoped to do as a career. After 5 years in the IT industry as a team lead, documentation manager, and training supervisor, I enrolled at Epicodus to pursue my goal of being a developer.

          I'm currently interning with a company that builds case management software for nonprofits, utilizing my knowledge of C# to write tests for the application in Selenium, and making use of my technical writing expertise to update the user guides.
